# CrossTech Website — AI Guide

> Entry point for any AI/developer working on this repo. Read this first, then

## What this is

The **public marketing website** of CrossTech — an **AI-first software studio**
(contact: info@crosstech.solutions). Live at **https://crosstech.solutions**,
deployed on **Firebase Hosting**. NOTE (owner decision, 2026-08-31): the site
deliberately shows **no physical location** — copy says "working with clients
worldwide". Don't reintroduce Pretoria/South Africa into site copy.

History: founded 2019 as a mobile-app development company; **pivoted in 2026**
to building software broadly with AI as the primary focus. The site was fully
rebuilt on 2026-08-31 to match: modern hand-written HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, dark
"AI studio" design, **zero build step, zero frameworks** (jQuery/Bootstrap and
the old 2019 template are gone — retired to `_old/`, which is gitignored).
What is in `public/` is exactly what gets deployed.

## Hard rules for this repo

1. **This repo is PUBLIC on GitHub** (`github.com/crosstech-solutions-bv/crosstech-site`).
   **Never commit credentials, API keys, service accounts, tokens, or `.env`
   files.** There are none today — keep it that way.
   - The Firebase web config is intentionally NOT in the repo: `contact.html`
     loads the SDK and config from Firebase Hosting's **reserved URLs**
     (`/__/firebase/10.14.1/firebase-*-compat.js`, `/__/firebase/init.js`),
     injected at serve time. Do not replace this with an inline
     `firebaseConfig` object.
   - Project IDs in `.firebaserc` (`crosstech-1adc3`, `crosstech-site`) are
     identifiers, not secrets.
2. **No frameworks, no build step.** Keep it vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Design
   tokens live at the top of `public/css/style.css` — change colors/spacing
   there, not ad hoc.
3. Legal pages (`privacy.html`, `terms.html`) are published policies for
   CrossTech's **mobile apps** (app stores link to them). Their wording was
   deliberately kept verbatim in the 2026 redesign — only the page chrome
   changed. Do not alter their substance without the owner's explicit request.
   Full trace + known gaps: `docs/legal-pages.md`.
4. The contact-form **lead document shape must not change** (field names
   `name/subject/to/query/message{...}/...`) — a mail process on the Firebase
   project side consumes it. See `docs/architecture.md`.

## Conventions

- **Internal links are extensionless** (`/about`, `/privacy`) — `firebase.json`
  has `"cleanUrls": true`. Plain `python -m http.server` will 404 on them;
  preview with `firebase serve`.
- **Chrome is still duplicated** per page (no build step): header + footer +
  font/css includes are copy-pasted in all 7 pages. A shared change must be
  applied to: index, about, services, contact, privacy, terms (404 has no
  chrome). Nav marks the current page with `aria-current="page"`.
- Fonts: Space Grotesk (display) + Inter (body), self-hosted from `public/fonts/`
  (`@font-face` at the top of style.css; never re-add Google Fonts links). Icons are
  emoji in `.card .icon` — no icon font.
- Scroll-in animation = add class `reveal`; `js/main.js` handles the rest
  (with reduced-motion fallback).
- Video: plain `<video>` tags, no player library. `/swing-mcp#video` is the only page with a
  playable video (chapter buttons seek via inline script); the hero uses a muted autoplay loop.
  `/video/**` and `/img/**` are cached one week (firebase.json) — bump the file name to replace a
  video, don't overwrite in place.

## How to run / deploy

- Preview: `firebase serve` (required for clean URLs AND for the contact form's
  `/__/firebase/*` scripts; opening files directly won't exercise either).
- **Deploy everything: `node deploy.mjs`** (`-P production` for the prod
  alias; `--skip-functions` for hosting + Firestore only). The script lints
  and builds functions, refuses to deploy them if nothing is exported (an
  empty functions deploy prompts to delete live functions), then runs one
  `firebase deploy --only hosting,firestore,functions`.
- First functions deploy: needs the Blaze plan; the CLI prompts for SMTP
  params (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, MAIL_FROM, MAIL_NOTIFY) and the
  SMTP_PASS secret. Values land in Firebase, never in the repo
  (`functions/.env*` is gitignored).
- One-time per project: the **Secret Manager API** must be enabled in Google
  Cloud before the SMTP_PASS secret can be stored (403 from
  secretmanager.googleapis.com otherwise) — enable it at
  console.developers.google.com/apis/api/secretmanager.googleapis.com for the
  target project, wait a minute, re-run the deploy. The CLI auto-enables the
  other required APIs (Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Cloud Run) itself.

## Open items

See `docs/known-issues.md` — headline items: rules + SDK upgrade need a deploy
and an end-to-end form test; the privacy policy still only covers the mobile
apps, not the website's own lead collection (owner's call).
